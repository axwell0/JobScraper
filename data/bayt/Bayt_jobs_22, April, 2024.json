        "Mission and objectives": " The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) is the UN\u2019s capital investment agency for the world\u2019s 46 least developed countries. With its capital mandate and instruments, UNCDF offers \u201clast mile\u201d finance models that unlock public and private resources, especially at the domestic level, to reduce poverty and support local economic development. UNCDF\u2019s financing models work through two channels: financial inclusion that expands the opportunities for individuals, households, and small businesses to participate in the local economy, providing them with the tools they need to climb out of poverty and manage their financial lives; and by showing how localized investments \u2014 through fiscal decentralization, innovative municipal finance, and structured project finance \u2014 can drive public and private funding that underpins local economic expansion and sustainable development. By strengthening how finance works for poor people at the household, small enterprise, and local infrastructure levels, UNCDF contributes to SDG 1 on eradicating poverty and SDG 17 on the means of implementation. By identifying those market segments where innovative financing models can have transformational impact in helping to reach the last mile and address exclusion and inequalities of access, UNCDF contributes to a number of different SDGs. The Local Climate Adaptive Living (LoCAL) facility of the UNCDF was designed and launched in 2011 with the aim of promoting climate change-resilient communities and local economies by establishing a standard and internationally recognized country-based mechanism to channel climate finance to local government authorities (LGAs) in LDCs and to increase local resilience, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly the specific goals of poverty eradication (SDG1) and climate action (SDG13). LoCAL increases awareness and capacities to respond to climate change at the local level, integrates climate change adaptation into local governments' planning and budgeting systems, in a participatory and gender-sensitive manner, and increases the amount of finance available to local governments for climate change adaptation. LoCAL focuses on the delivery of four outputs that will directly contribute to increasing local governments\u2019 access to climate finance and building resilience to climate change: \u2022 Output 1 \u2013 Awareness and capacities to respond to climate change adaptation at the local level are increased; \u2022 Output 2 \u2013 Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) is mainstreamed into government\u2019s planning and budgeting systems and investments are implemented in line with the Performance-Based Climate Resilience Grants (PBCRG) mechanism; \u2022 Output 3 \u2013 The PBCRG system is effectively and sustainably established in participating countries and leads to an increased amount of CCA finance available to local government and local economy; \u2022 Output 4 \u2013 The role of local authorities and of the PBCRGs in addressing climate change are increasingly recognized at international level, through outreach, learning and quality assurance.",
        "Context": " LoCAL combines performance-based climate resilience grants (PBCRGs) with technical and capacity-building support. PBCRGs ensure programming and verification of climate change expenditures at the local level and offer strong incentives for general performance improvements targeting areas of importance for enhanced resilience. The PBCRG can be seen as an earmarked cross-sectoral grant with conditions attached to the use of its funding for climate change adaptation beyond business as usual. Combined with regular grant allocations, PBCRGs enable 100 per cent of the investments in climate-sensitive sectors to become climate resilient over time. The PBCRGs consist of a financial top-up to cover the additional costs of making investments climate resilient and/or of additional investments for climate change adaptation. These grants complement regular allocations made by the central level to local governments through the respective intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. They include a set of minimum conditions, performance measures and a menu of eligible investments. The Programme operates in three distinct phases: \uf0d8 Phase I: Piloting, consists of an initial scoping analysis, followed by testing in two to four local governments. \uf0d8 Phase II: Consolidating, takes place in 5\u201310 local governments in a country. It involves collecting lessons and demonstrating the mechanism\u2019s effectiveness at a larger scale. \uf0d8 Phase III: Scaling-up, is full national roll-out of LoCAL based on the results of the previous phases and lessons learned. LoCAL is gradually extended to all local governments, with domestic or international climate finance, and becomes the national system for channeling adaptation finance to the local level. LoCAL in Mediterranean countries The Mediterranean region has been identified as a climate change hotspot, warming some 20% faster than the global average and causing a wide range of negative impacts on the environment, the availability of food and water, human health and security. In urban areas, climate change impacts are aggravated compounded, given the by high population density. In the Mediterranean, in 2018, 60% of people already lived in urban areas, and continued urbanization trends are expected to further exacerbate the climate crisis and put further pressure on natural resources and the environment UNCDF has been selected as implementing partner by the European Union (DG NEAR) to seek to alleviate key bottlenecks to finance urban and local priorities as identified in countries\u2019 Nationally Determined Contributions and other climate policies to truly localize climate actions. within the Programme \u201cAdvancing Climate Adaptation in the Southern Mediterranean (ACA-MED)\u201d.

Nous sommes pr\u00e9sents sur le terrain dans 170 pays et territoires, travaillant avec les gouvernements et les populations pour trouver leurs propres solutions aux d\u00e9fis de d\u00e9veloppement mondiaux et nationaux afin de contribuer \u00e0 l\u2019autonomisation des vies et \u00e0 la construction de nations r\u00e9silientes. L'Agenda 2030 des objectifs de d\u00e9veloppement durable (ODD) et l'engagement de ne laisser personne de c\u00f4t\u00e9 refl\u00e8tent l'interd\u00e9pendance des questions de sant\u00e9 et de d\u00e9veloppement durable telles que l'aggravation des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques et sociales, la crise climatique, l'urbanisation rapide, le fardeau persistant du VIH et d'autres maladies infectieuses (par exemple, paludisme, tuberculose, COVID.19), le fardeau croissant des maladies non transmissibles et l\u2019\u00e9mergence de menaces pour la sant\u00e9. La port\u00e9e et l\u2019ampleur de la prestation de sant\u00e9 et de bien-\u00eatre pour tous exigent des partenariats et des financements innovants. Le partenariat du PNUD avec le Fonds Mondial (GF), conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie \u00ab\u00a0VIH et sant\u00e9 2022-2025 du PNUD : \u00ab Connecter les points\u00a0\u00bb, apporte une contribution essentielle au Plan strat\u00e9gique 2022-2025 du PNUD, \u00e0 l'Agenda 2030 pour le d\u00e9veloppement durable et \u00e0 l'engagement de ne laissez personne de c\u00f4t\u00e9. Sur demande, le PNUD agit en tant que r\u00e9cipiendaire principal (RP) par int\u00e9rim, travaillant avec les partenaires nationaux et le Fonds Mondial pour assurer la gestion, la mise en \u0153uvre et la supervision des subventions du Fonds Mondial, tout en renfor\u00e7ant simultan\u00e9ment les institutions et les syst\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 pour que les entit\u00e9s nationales assument le r\u00f4le de PR au fil du temps. Le PNUD joue un r\u00f4le important dans le soutien aux r\u00e9sultats en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 en aidant les pays \u00e0 s'attaquer aux d\u00e9terminants sociaux, culturels et \u00e9conomiques du VIH et de la sant\u00e9, en partenariat avec les entit\u00e9s des Nations Unies et d'autres organisations. Cela se fait gr\u00e2ce au travail principal du PNUD visant \u00e0 r\u00e9duire les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s et l\u2019exclusion sociale qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine du VIH et d\u2019une mauvaise sant\u00e9, \u00e0 promouvoir une gouvernance efficace et inclusive de la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 construire des syst\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 r\u00e9silients et durables. Le PNUD contribue \u00e9galement, par son r\u00f4le de coordination et de rassemblement, \u00e0 rassembler de multiples partenaires et ressources aux niveaux national et local. En tant que partenaire de confiance \u00e0 long terme du Fonds Mondial (FM), la proposition de valeur du PNUD consiste \u00e0 fournir un ensemble int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de solutions de d\u00e9veloppement pour renforcer les institutions charg\u00e9es de fournir des services de sant\u00e9. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ses contributions en tant que r\u00e9cipiendaire principal (PR) par int\u00e9rim et fournisseur d\u2019assistance technique dans plus de 53 pays depuis 2003, la fourniture par le PNUD d\u2019un soutien int\u00e9gr\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de politique, de mise en \u0153uvre et de d\u00e9veloppement des capacit\u00e9s aux pays a produit des r\u00e9sultats significatifs en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de d\u00e9veloppement. Le Fonds Mondial a approuv\u00e9 un financement pour la riposte contre le VIH en Alg\u00e9rie et en Tunisie. Le PNUD a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 comme R\u00e9cipiendaire Principal pour g\u00e9rer ce projet r\u00e9gional couvrant les deux pays.

Dans cette perspective, le PNUD recrute un Analyste Administratif et Financier afin de coordonner et articuler au quotidien toutes les activit\u00e9s inh\u00e9rentes aux domaines Finance pour la subvention VIH. Sous la supervision directe et la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Conseiller Technique Principal, l'Analyste Financier est charg\u00e9 d'assurer la plus grande efficacit\u00e9 dans la gestion des ressources financi\u00e8res et la fourniture d'informations financi\u00e8res pr\u00e9cises, minutieusement recherch\u00e9es et document\u00e9es, la prestation efficace des services financiers et l'utilisation transparente des ressources financi\u00e8res et gestion des finances de la subvention VIH.
